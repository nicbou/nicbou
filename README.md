I run a website called [All About Berlin](https://allaboutberlin.com) that helps people [move to Berlin](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/moving-to-berlin), [find a job](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), [find an apartment](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), [start their own business](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) and survive German bureaucracy.

In my free time, I build other things for fun. Currently, I'm working on a [timeline thing](https://nicolasbouliane.com/projects/timeline).
